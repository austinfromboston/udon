Udon is a flexible ludicrous-speed prototyping system built on Sinatra and MongoDB.  You supply a configuration file specified using the Udon DSL, which describes both the display and the model for very simple applications.  

Udon applications serve as live prototypes that can be updated by changing a single file.  A goal of this project is to offer the capability to "print" the generated application into code for Rails or Sinatra once the prototyping phase is complete.
